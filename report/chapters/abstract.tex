	\section*{Abstract}
	In this research, we’re going to develop and evaluate a mobile app to help small businesses manage their sales and inventory. We’ll be using the Flutter framework to build the app and Firebase to store the data. Our main goal is to figure out what challenges small businesses face when it comes to managing sales and inventory, and then create an affordable mobile app solution to help them out. By doing this research, we hope to make it easier for small businesses to manage their sales and inventory, which could help them make more money.
